Identify an area of JS code in the final solution (ttt5) you feel really good about â€“ and indicate why.
I think I feel good about this part of the code:
                const winConditions = [
                    marks[0] + marks[1] + marks[2],
                    marks[3] + marks[4] + marks[5],
                    marks[6] + marks[7] + marks[8],
                    marks[0] + marks[3] + marks[6],
                    marks[1] + marks[4] + marks[7],
                    marks[2] + marks[5] + marks[8],
                    marks[0] + marks[4] + marks[8],
                    marks[2] + marks[4] + marks[6],
                ];
because it's clear to read and allows for the 8 possible outcomes for the tic tac toe game. It was more straightforward to figure out how to write than the other parts of the code.
